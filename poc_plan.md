Below is our rough plan to POC with tasks and roles:

### Desk research
- [] Read the book on Polish Wordnet (@dchaplinsky)
- [] Calculate metrics on the depth and distribution of LU in the Polish wordnet (@dchaplinsky)
- [] Calculate metrics on the depth and distribution of LU in English wordnet (@dchaplinsky)
- [] Find overlap metrics between English and Polish wordnet ontology (@dchaplinsky)
- [] Investigate dbpedia/wiktionary as a source of data and describe the findings (@vseloved)

### Support
- [] Create an RDF example of the simple wordnet (@vseloved) [turtle example 1](http://wordnet-rdf.princeton.edu/about), [turtle example 2](https://github.com/globalwordnet/english-wordnet)
- [] Load aforementioned example to the Gruff (@vseloved)
- [] Generate couple of access tokens to Google Translate Cloud Service (@mariana-scorp, @vseloved, @dchaplinsky) using their $300 credit proposition

### Development
- [] Export top-level mixed ontology from pl/PWN to the RDF triplets (@dchaplinsky)
- [] Visualise it for @mariana-scorp (@dchaplinsky)
- [] Decide on the desired depth of high-level ontology (@mariana-scorp)
- [] Describe methodology for the creation of high-level ontology in a separate document (@mariana-scorp)
- [] Compile the high-level ontology for Ukrainian language (@mariana-scorp)
